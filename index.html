<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage! My name is Biplab Paul, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusatts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I worked in Dr. Alan Mullen's lab primarily on gene expression of liver tissue. My goal from this postdoc fellowship is 
  to map the variation of gene expression accross different region of liver tissue. This will ultimately leads understand how changes in gene
  expression accros liver tissue leads to liver diseases.

I maintain a list of my publications, previous research projects and implementations under the <a href="research">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/biplabua">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog and pin them down <a href="blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="about">about me</a>.</p>
