I am Biplab Paul, born and grown up in Bangladesh. After completing undergraduate degree from Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline at Khulna University, I moved to Canada to finish my graduate study. I have completed Masters in Biochemistry from University of Regina, under supervision of Dr. Tanya Dahms, who is a great mentor and inspiration for me. I used atomic force microscopy to surface ultrastructure of filamentous fungus agpergillus nidulans. I thought I would continue in the field of bionanotechnology, so decided to persue PhD at Dahms group. But shortly after begining of PhD I became very interested in genetics and molecular biology, when I told Tanya about my interest, she was very supportive to my decision to leave her lab. In fall 2013, I join at Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta to puruse PhD at Dr. Ben Montpetit lab. My PhD research focuses on RNA Biology, more specifically how accumulation of polyadenylated ncRNA affect overall gene expression. At the end of my PhD I felt attracted to the field of ncRNA, therefore decided to pursue postdoctoral study with Dr. Alan Mullen at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School to study ncRNA biology and liver diseases.
